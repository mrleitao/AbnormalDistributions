These data sources were all compiled and aggregated by zip codes localized to the City of Los Angeles.

The data used for our crime statistics were complied using reverse geocoding methods from longitude and latitudes provided by the initial data source.

To compile this data, we used Amazon Web Services utilizing their free virtual computers to run this reverse geo coding.

All the methods and code used for this process are located as part of this repository. Full data file to big to upload, contact me if you want access.  R Code Will Be Uploaded within 24 Hours
